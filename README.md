# AssemblyAI Slack Bot

You cannot develop using the same Slack app at one time, so each contributor should create their own Slack app.
You can use the [manifest.json](./manifest.json) to configure your Slack app, but make sure to replace `https://2cf5-72-221-14-208.ngrok-free.app` with your own public URL.
